! Description: 

! (Optional; does not work in Adblock Plus) If you have made multiple
! lists on the same server, and want the users of one list to auto-load
! another list, you can use "!#include" followed by the filename of the
! other list to do so. You can usually only include lists from the same
! repo or server. Multiple lists can be included. PS: It'd be bad sport
! to abuse this function by adding lists about irrelevant topics.
!#include whitelist.txt
!#include

! All comments that are not list entries, shall be prefaced by a ! or a
! #. This tells the adblocker that this line does not indicate a thing
! that shall be blocked. This is conventionally used to write remarks,
! or to explain the purpose of the entry/entries that are below that
! line.
