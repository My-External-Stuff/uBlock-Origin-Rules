This changelog is only used for "Major" changes to the list setup, like

03. May 2021
  - Added a new list `rules/noise.txt` which is to remove all the noises
    from a any webpage. Noise is useless junk that have nothing to do with
    how @spirillen is using a website.

    Do only use this list if you really don't care about breaking things.
