This changelog is only used for "Major" changes to the list setup, like
new files, sorting or including new external sources.

6. January 2024
    Version 0.0.4

  - Updated the many lists of Fanboys (@ryanbr) from EasyList

    have change the number of active maintained sources.
  - Fixed the url in the import template.

21. May 2023
  - Renaming our two spyware files into `privacy.rules` & `privacy.domain`
    This is done to make the rules cover broader as it in fact already
    includes both spyware and tracking rules.    

1.  July 2022
  - Update of urls to point to Jira support board.
  - Updated urls to match confluence:
    https://spirillen.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UOBR

  - Add link to GitLab and Jira (atlassian)

2.  May 2021
  - Added a new list `rules/noise.txt` which is to remove all the noises
    from a any webpage. Noise is useless junk that have nothing to do with
    how @spirillen is using a website.

    Do only use this list if you really don't care about breaking things.
